{#
    # Homepage template
    # ---------------
    #
    # When this template gets loaded, it will be because someone has accessed
    # http://yoursite.com/ (without any URI). Craft checks to see if you have
    # a Single section set to be the Homepage (as you do, by default), and
    # loads the section’s Template (this file). A special ‘entry’ variable
    # will already be set for you, assigned to the Homepage entry.
    #
    # It's worth noting that even if you didn't have a Homepage Single section,
    # as long as this template remains at craft/templates/index.html, it
    # would still be the one to get loaded when accessing http://yoursite.com/,
    # albeit without an ‘entry’ variable already set for you.
    #
